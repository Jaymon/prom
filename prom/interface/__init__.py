    configure interfaces based on environment variables

    by default, when prom is imported, it will look for PROM_DSN, and PROM_DSN_N (where
    N is 1 through infinity) in the environment, if it finds them, it will assume they
    are dsn urls that prom understands and will configure db connections with them. If you
    don't want this behavior (ie, you want to configure prom manually) then just make sure
    you don't have any environment variables with matching names

    The num checks (eg PROM_DSN_1, PROM_DSN_2) go in order, so you can't do PROM_DSN_1, PROM_DSN_3,
    because it will fail on _2 and move on, so make sure your num dsns are in order (eg, 1, 2, 3, ...)

    example --
        export PROM_DSN_1=some.Interface://host:port/dbname#i1

        $ python
